    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fudge is a type of homemade candy with a smooth and creamy texture. It's usually made on the stove with sugar, butter, and milk. There are many varieties of fudge, but the most popular type is chocolate.</p>
    <p>This simplified version comes together quickly in the 
        microwave with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Meanwhile, generously grease an 8-inch square glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Remove chocolate mixture from the microwave and stir in nuts. Pour into the prepared dish.</li>
